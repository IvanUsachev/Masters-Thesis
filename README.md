# Master’s Thesis Project

As part of my master’s thesis, a modular web-based application was developed for automated face recognition and deepfake detection in video streams. The system integrates two state-of-the-art deep learning models: InsightFace (with ArcFace loss and a lightweight backbone) for accurate identity recognition, and a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) for detecting manipulated facial content. Models were trained and evaluated using benchmark datasets such as FaceForensics++. Implemented in Flask with a user-friendly browser interface, the application supports video upload, real-time webcam analysis, batch testing, and GPU-accelerated processing. Additional features include identity enrollment, embedding management, and real-time result feedback.
