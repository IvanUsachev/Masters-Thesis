                <p><strong>Ivan Usachev â€“ Masterâ€™s Thesis Project:</strong> As part of this master's thesis, a modular web-based application was developed for automated face recognition and deepfake detection in video streams. The system integrates two state-of-the-art deep learning models: <strong>InsightFace</strong> for face identification and <strong>Vision Transformer (ViT)</strong> for detecting manipulated facial content. The face recognition module leverages the InsightFace framework with ArcFace loss and a lightweight backbone, enabling fast and accurate recognition of both known and unknown individuals across diverse conditions. The deepfake detection component is based on a fine-tuned Vision Transformer, trained and evaluated on benchmark datasets such as <em>FaceForensics++</em> to ensure robust performance. The application is implemented using Flask and features a user-friendly browser interface. Users can upload videos, analyze webcam streams, or perform batch testing with CSV output. Real-time feedback is provided for each detected identity. Furthermore, the system supports enrollment of new identities, management of saved embeddings, and GPU-accelerated batch processing for enhanced performance.</p>
